    "type": "Plastic",
    "disposal": "Recycling",
    "process": "Plastic is sorted by type and color, cleaned, shredded into flakes, melted, and then molded into new products.",
    "description": "Only 9% of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled.",
    "percentage_landfill": 79,
    "lanfill_contribution": 18.5,
    "impact": "Recycling plastic reduces the need for new plastic production, conserving fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

  {
    "id": 5,
    "type": "Organic Waste",
    "disposal": "Composting",
    "process": "Organic waste is decomposed through aerobic processes to produce compost, which can be used as a soil amendment.",
    "description": "Food waste makes up about 24% of all municipal solid waste in landfills.",
    "percentage_landfill": 24,
    "lanfill_contribution": 22.0,
    "impact": "Composting organic waste returns nutrients to the soil, reduces methane emissions from landfills, and supports sustainable agriculture."

  {
    "id": 6,
    "type": "Electronics",
    "disposal": "Recycling",
    "process": "Electronics are disassembled, hazardous materials are removed, and components such as metals and plastics are separated and recycled.",
    "description": "E-waste represents only 2% of America's trash in landfills, but it equals 70% of overall toxic waste.",
    "percentage_going_to_landfill": 80,
    "lanfill_contribution": 1.4,
    "impact": "Recycling electronics recovers valuable materials, reduces environmental pollution, and supports the creation of new electronic products from reused components."
